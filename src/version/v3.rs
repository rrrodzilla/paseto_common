/// ## Version 3: NIST Modern
///
/// See [the version 3 specification](https://github.com/paseto-standard/paseto-spec/blob/master/docs/01-Protocol-Versions/Version3.md) for details. At a glance:
///
/// * **`v3.local`**: Symmetric Authenticated Encryption:
///     * AES-256-CTR + HMAC-SHA384 (Encrypt-then-MAC)
///     * Key-splitting: HKDF-SHA384
///         * Info for encryption key: `paseto-encryption-key`
///           The encryption key and implicit counter nonce are both returned
///           from HKDF in this version.
///         * Info for authentication key: `paseto-auth-key-for-aead`
///     * 32-byte nonce (no longer prehashed), passed entirely to HKDF
///       (as part of the `info` tag, rather than as a salt).
///     * The HMAC covers the header, nonce, and ciphertext
///       * It also covers the footer, if provided
///       * It also covers the implicit assertions, if provided
/// * **`v3.public`**: Asymmetric Authentication (Public-Key Signatures):
///     * ECDSA over NIST P-384, with SHA-384,
///       using [RFC 6979 deterministic k-values](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6979)
///       (if reasonably practical; otherwise a CSPRNG **MUST** be used).
///       Hedged signatures are allowed too.
///     * The public key is also included in the PAE step, to ensure
///       `v3.public` tokens provide Exclusive Ownership.
